# Music-generator
Experimental algorithmic music generator. 
It's often said of Mozart that he claimed to see his compositions not in a linear uni-directional fashion as they're written, but rather all at once. I believe this is 
because Mr.Mozart was not seeing musical notes, but rather, seeing an algorithm. With this, I aim to find proof. (Or at least have some fun!)
